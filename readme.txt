How to use:
1. Copy the PointerFocus folder from the Zip file to any path of your computer.
2. Run the PointerFocus application file from the copied folder. 


Note: We don't recommend copying PointerFocus to [C:\Program Files] folder. 
If you do so, you need to run PointerFocus as administrator to make it work properly in some version of Windows.  Because [C:\Program Files] is protected by system, so application needs higher privilege to save configuration data in this folder. 


How to uninstall:
Just delete the PointerFocus folder from your computer.
